# Zepto Inventory Data Analysis

**Project Overview**  
This is a SQL‑based portfolio project modeled on a real‑world **Zepto** e‑commerce inventory dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. Guided by the YouTube tutorial _“Complete SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project with Real Zepto Data”_ created by **Amlan Mohanty**, I wrote SQL queries in PostgreSQL to clean, analyze, and uncover actionable business insights that retail/e‑commerce analysts care about.

## ✅ Project Objectives
1. Load and clean the Zepto inventory dataset (handling nulls, zero values, converting paise → ₹).  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL.  
3. Answer nine key business‑focused insights via SQL queries.  
4. Summarize findings with visualizations (optional) and narrative.

## 🧠 Insights (the nine project questions & answers)
1. Which product SKUs have the **highest discount%**?  
2. What high‑MRP products (e.g. MRP > ₹500) are **out of stock**?  
3. What is the **estimated revenue per category** (quantity × price)?  
4. Which categories have the **highest average discounts**?  
5. Which SKUs offer the **best price per gram** value?  
6. How many products are in **Low / Medium / Bulk weight segments**?  
7. What is the **total inventory weight per category**?  
8. Which products are **out‑of‑stock yet high‑MRP**, indicating missed opportunity?  
9. Which SKUs have **zero quantity sold but high stock**, indicating overstock risk?
